CPCTools 0.2.0
(c) Ramlaid 2005

1) About CPCTools
-----------------

This package contains some few tools that I create during my CPC development under a Win32 environement.
It's include general tools like file manager or image viewer and purely developement tools like Dams converter,
data linker or snapshot creator.

This is a Windows version but it might compile under Linux, DOS & maybe other platform. Unfortunatly, I have'nt
time to do these port. Any help would be appreciate !

All the sources a in C++ (and a bit commented but mainly in french, sorry for english guys !).

WARNING : all these tools are under developpement ! bug report & remark will be appreciate ! (This is also the
case for this small doc)

2) CPCFS
--------

Include a lib and a executable. The libcpcfs use libDSK from John Eliott (version 1.1.6 but it might work with
more recent version). What the libcpcfs is doing is just managing CPC file system over libDSK physical DSK management.
(I also include a libdskrc file in order to manage more file format)

CPCFS : This tool take a .dsk and manage file on this .dsk. Getting/putting with binary mode & on the fly header
creation. There few option and only 2 file system managed (DATA and SYSTEM). 

cpcfs <disc> <command> [option] [file *] [-s]
Commands :
        c  : catalogue
        f  : disc format
        p  : put file
             -ch : header creation when putting
             -b : binary mode
        g  : get file
             -nh : no header when getting
        ga : get all file
             -nh : no header when getting
        r  : rename file
        d  : delete file
        i  : print disc info
        h  : print file header
Options
		-s : select side B
When putting or getting file, you can use [<user>:]name.ext[,S][,P][,start][,exec]

Ex :
Putting a file on the DSK
	cpcfs myDisk.dsk p myFile

Putting a binary file and create header (start 0x1000 and exe 0x1050) on the fly:
	cpcfs myDisk.dsk p myFile.bin,0x1000,0x1050

I originaly create this tools under Linux and use it with a real 3'5 disk !
cpcfs /dev/fd0 c

Might work also under windows using libdsk extension fdrawcmd.sys (WARNING ! Use at your own risk !)
cpcfs a: c

3) CPCFSExt
-----------

This is a shell extension for Windows Explorer. It had a new "CPCFS tools" context menu on right clicking of file, .dsk or directory.
What does CPCFSExt on right clicking :
	
	a. Background
		- Create...
			Create a new DSK in the current directory, default format is Data 40 tracks
		- Create ??.dsk
			Create a new DSK using current directory name, default format is Data 40 tracks
	
	b. DSK file (single selection) (if the file is not a .dsk, you can't get this context menu !)
		- Extract all to...
			Extract all files (keeping header) to a given directory
		- Extract all here
			Extract all files (keeping header) to current directory
		- Extract to ??\
			Extract all files (keeping header) to directory named like ??.dsk
		- Catalogue
			Display a catalogue interface of the current .dsk
		- Disc Info
			Display disc information of the current .dsk
		- Send to A:
			... NOT IMPLEMENTED ...
		- Send to CPCBooster
			... NOT IMPLEMENTED ...
		- Format
			Format current .dsk using dsk format specification (all file deleted !)
	
	c. DSK file (mutiple selection) (if one file is not a dsk, you can't get this context menu !)
		- Extract all to directories
			Extract all file of each .dsk to directory named like ??.dsk
		- Extract all here
			Extract all file of each .dsk to current directory
			
	d. File (single selection and multiple selection)
		- Add to...
			Add current file(s) to a given .dsk (no header created on the fly)
		- Add to ??.dsk
			Add current file(s) to a dsk name like current directory (no header created on the fly)
		- Send to A:
			... NOT IMPLEMENTED ...
		- Send to CPCBooster
			... NOT IMPLEMENTED ...
		
		If the file is a binary file (single selection only) :
		- Edit header
			Display a interface to edit AMSDOS file header (start address & execution address)
		- Remove header
			Remove AMSDOS file header
		
		If the file is not a binary file (single selection only) :
		- Add header
			Display a interface to add AMSDOS file header (start address & execution address)
	
	e. Directory (single selection)
		- Add all file to...
			Add all file in directory to a given .dsk (no header created on the fly)
		- Add all file to ??.dsk
			Add all file in directory to a .dsk named like selected directory (no header created on the fly)
	
	f. Directory (multiple selection)
		- Add all file to *.dsk
			For each directory, add all file in directory to a .dsk named like current directory (no header created on the fly)

This is a first release. If you think there is some missing functionnality, please contact me. 
I'm also looking on explorer namespace extension in order to use .dsk like directories (drag & drop, rename, etc... inside explorer).
It seems to be possible, but I haven't already start the development, if you are interested, please contact me.

4) CPCFileViewer
----------------

Include a lib and a executable. The lib use SDL for displaying.

* cpcFileViewer :
This tools load the file and display it using a standard CPC video mode. It can load screen, windows and font
file data. It manage also OCP file format .SCR and .WIN (including compressed one) as well as .PAL (when loading
myScreen.SCR, it try to find a myScreen.PAL).
If the tools detect a standard CPC header, it's automatically remove it in order to display only binary data of 
the loaded file.

In all mode :
	CTRL + left / right 		: change CRTC R1 value
	CTRL + up / down 		: change CRTC R6 value
	F1 				: switch to screen display mode
	F2 				: switch to window display mode
	F3 				: switch to font display mode
	0,1,2 				: change video mode

In Window display mode :
	left / right 			: change width of window
	up / down 			: change height of window
	
In Font display mode :
	left / right 			: change width of a single character
	up / down 			: change height of a single character
	SHFT + left / right 		: change the number of character displayed
	v / h 				: switch between vertical and horizontal display of each character
	
usage : cpcFileViewer myScreen.scr

Remark : under windows, assign .SCR and .WIN to be opened using cpcFileViewer and you can run it directly under
Explorer by double clicking on .SCR or .WIN files.

* libVideoCPC :
You can use this lib to display your data in CPC video mode. It's include a CPCVideo object creation and many 
method on this object (putting / getting byte, window, pixel, etc...). It also include a small SDL management
over CPCVideo screen (see source code for example ! ;).

Remark : this lib can easily be use to create a drawing tool, but it need to be include in a real GUI, 
and I don't plan to make these development yet.

5) createSnapshot
-----------------

This tools can create and modify a emulator .SNA file. 
During developement I use this tool to create .SNA file containing datas, graphics and code.
Using a config file (or command line option) you can easily create an auto executable .SNA file i.e
when you load it under an emulator, it's automatically start.

Usage : createSnapshot <filename.sna> [-i $1] [-l $1 $2]* [-p $1 $2]* [-s $1 $2]
* [-x] [-r] [-e] [-d] [-c $1] [-t] [-h]
Create a Amstrad CPC snapshot <filename.sna>
Default snapshot : 6128, CRTC 0, rom deconnected, no interrupt, CRTC standard value

        -i <$1> | --inSnapshot <$1>
                Load <$1> snapshot file
        -l <$1> <$2> | --loadFileData <$1> <$2>
                Load <$1> file data at <$2> address in snapshot memory
        -p <$1> <$2> | --putData <$1> <$2>
                Put <$1> byte at <$2> address in snapshot memory
        -s <$1> <$2> | --setToken <$1> <$2>
                Set snapshot token <$1> to value <$2>
                Use <$1>:<val> to set array value
                ex '-s CRTC_REG:6 20' : Set CRTC register 6 to 20
        -x | --clearMemory
                Clear snapshot memory
        -r | --romDeconnect
                Deconnect lower and upper rom
        -e | --enableInterrupt
                Enable interrupt
        -d | --disableInterrupt
                Disable interrupt
        -c <$1> | --configFile <$1>
                Load a config file with createSnapshot option
        -t | --tokenList
                Display setable snapshot token ID
        -h | --help
                Display help

------------------

Small tool to generate a text file with db ??,??,?? where value a taken from a binary file
dataDBGenerator <myFile.bin> <myFile.txt>

8) dataLinker
-------------

This tool pack many input data file in one or more output data file. It's also generate a source file with right
data definition.
It automatically organize data in order to minimize memory usage (according to data address masking)

Usage : dataLinker <-z $1 $2 $3 $4>+ <-d $1 $2 $3>+ [-o $1] [-c $1] [-h]
Link data and create a .z80 file

        -z <$1> <$2> <$3> <$4> | --zone <$1> <$2> <$3> <$4>
                Define a zone named $1 in bank $2 from $3 to $4
        -d <$1> <$2> <$3> | --dataFilename <$1> <$2> <$3>
                Load a data file $1 with label $2 and mask $3 to be linked
        -o <$1> | --output <$1>
                Z80 output filename
        -c <$1> | --configFile <$1>
                Configuration file
        -h | --help
                Display help

myConfigFile.cfg :
;********************************************
; Load all data file and try to put them into the 2 data zone define
; For data place in memory, output a :
; LABEL EQU address
; in the output file (to be include in your general file source)
; The 3 first datas are aligned to address with low byte = 0

-z zone.da0 			0xc0 0x1000 0x3fff
-z zone.da1 			0xc0 0x5000 0x7fff

-d curvePos.dat		T_CURVE_POS 		0xff00
-d curveHeight.dat 	T_CURVE_HAUT 		0xff00
-d curveMove.dat 	T_CURVE_MOVE		0xff00
-d logo.dat			T_ADR_GFX_LOGO 		0xffff
-d bottom.dat		T_ADR_GFX_BOTTOM 	0xffff
-d top.dat			T_ADR_GFX_TOP 		0xffff

-o dataAddress.z80
;*********************************************
                
9) Other tools
--------------

In the 'tools' directory you can find 'optionParser.h' and 'optionParser.c'. Theses function are used to manage
command line option parsing (using a simple option structure description).
You can also reuse this piece of code ! ;)

10) Future developpement
------------------------

Continue to make these tools better and better (error management, additionals options, ...)

Make a global SDK for CPC . For example :
	- text editing under Notepad / UltraEdit / Crimson editor / VC++
	- source code compiling using ZMac (and maybe linking ?), with symbol table & break point exporting
	- snapshot generation from datas using config file
	- automatic running of .SNA under emulator (WinApe or Arnold or ?) and using symbol table and breaking in a debugging phase
	- automatic running of .SNA on real CPC using CPCBooster + Arkos tools :)

I think we have a good base of tools to do this SDK, but we need to package all this in a single SDK...
	
11) License
-----------

No license at all ! You can use these tools freely. 
You can also modify all source code or include them into your own production (small credit will be enough ! ;).
