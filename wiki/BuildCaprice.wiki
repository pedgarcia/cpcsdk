You need wxWidget headers.
lib765 and libdsk can be used but they are optional.

=StSoundLib=
Don't use a version of StSoundLib you found somewhere else on the internet ! The one in our repository was fixed to sound more like a real CPC. The volume tables in he original are strange and the mixing is weird too.
{{{
cd cpctools/lib/StSoundLib_Release/StSoundLibrary/
./configure && make && sudo make install
}}}

 * installation
This is the recommended setting if you want to use caprice as a CPC emulator. Lib765 gives troubles and don't add extra functionality. Debug is useless unless you want to help us clean our code...
You can use other options for ./configure if you want to try things. But it will probably break things or make them run slower.
{{{
./configure --without-lib765 --without-debug
make
make install
