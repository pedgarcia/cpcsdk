#summary List of CPC programs that work and that don't in CapriceReloaded

= Introduction =
This table should be useful for developpers to get some hints about the problems that may be lying around in the emulator code. If you find something that does not work, please add it to the list so we can investigate. Please provide any information you may have.


= Details =

== Lib765 related problems ==
We have support fr lib765 as the FDC emulation backend. This should allow to use real floppies directly from within the emulator. However it does not work as well as the original FDC code from caprice.
||Program||Description of problem||
||Parasites||Part 1 will not run. Black screen and z80 registers aren't moving at all. The original Backtro is working fine. Works with old fdc rout.||
||Midline Process||Don't work with lib765/libdsk (read error), work with old fdc routine.||
||Orion Prime Teaser||Don't work with lib765/libdsk (read error), work with old fdc routine.||

== Classical FDC problems ==
||Program||Description of problem||
||Defender of the Crown||Reads track 1 sector 1 in a loop||
||Discology||When accessing editor, keeps reading something on the disk, looks like it's a not existing sector||
||Working backwards||Game 2 and 3 on side A are not loading and reset the CPC||
||zania||fails to display the catalog on first try, works on second try.||
||Orion Prime||Asks to insert side 1 while it's in the drive.||

==CRTC problems==
We only have CRTC0 emulation... but maybe it isn't perfect in some cases ?
||Program||Description of problem||
||Demoizart, Critical Area||screen splitting on the logo seems to happen too early||

== CRTC1 problems ==
||From Scratch||VBL happen too often, and overflows seem to happen, also crashes after some time||
||DTC||Splitscreen hapenning one line too late or too early||
||Backtro||Splitscreen hapenning one line too late or too early, screen not at 50Hz||

== Emulator detection ==
||Midline process||We are detected as emulator. Wrong FDC/drive timing||
||DTC||We are detected as emulator||

== Other/uncategorized problems ==
||Program||Description of problem||
||Demoizart, Landscape part||sound samples are broken||
||Climax G||Screen goes out of sync in some of the loading screens. May be related to the extreme settings used (reg0=127,...) and the use of GT65 sync that may not work on a CTM644||
